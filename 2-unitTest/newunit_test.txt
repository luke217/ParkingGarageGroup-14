new Testing

While my function is still in the process of being tested, 
the best way to test the file up to this point is to open
the file on the localhost and the superlot gmail will send
a text to my phone.  You can also test this on your phone
by editing the $to variable to be your number and carrier
provider in the email name.  The text box is for future use
as the number will need to be input or taken from the data-
base and updated for each user.  The email should be sent 
as soon as the file is opened on the localhost.  If it is 
not, check the readme and assure that you have the required 
updates to your .ini files and send mail app.
