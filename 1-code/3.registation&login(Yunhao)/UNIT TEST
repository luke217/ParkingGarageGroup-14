To run unit testing, please import the account.sql file to the phpMyadmin to build a database on Mysql.

From here, a new customer need to register to make a reservation.To accomplish the registration, the user will be notified to 
enter the first name,last name,password,email address,phone number and license plate number. The website will show a error 
message when the confirmation password is different with the password entred at the first time. Next, the system will connect
to the database to check whether the email address has already been used. When the double check finish, the new customer
information will be uploaded to the account database.

The unit testing will primarily involve trying to accomplish the registration without entering the the same confirmation password
as the one first time entered.Also,trying to use the same email address to register a new account.
