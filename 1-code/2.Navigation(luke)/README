Hi! This is luke's part: Navigation algorithm!
Basically, those three files have to be run on the localhost server and use the database from phpmyadmin as the others in the group.
1.connection.php is just file to build connection between the php files and the database used.
2.BuildAbstractedGraphfromParkinglot.php is the basic algorithm that extracts the relevant information from the database, 
and get weights ready for the graph where we will run the shortest path algorithm on.
3.ShortestPath.php is the file to use the algorithm to process the weights obtained from the database and get the final solution of 
navigation route to the assigned spot.

Since the User Interface of Mobile App is not ready yet, so I just print out the routes to each possible spots on the website.

Alert!
Just open the shortestPath.php with link: localhost/shortestPath.php
then you will see the results printed out on the website.
